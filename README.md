### **Bicycling in Sydney, Australia**  
Sydney has a growing but sometimes challenging cycling scene. The city has been investing in cycling infrastructure, with an expanding network of dedicated bike lanes, particularly in the city center, Inner West, and along the harbor foreshore. However, Sydney’s hilly terrain, heavy traffic, and patchy bike lane connectivity in some areas make it less bike-friendly compared to cities like Melbourne. Key cycling routes include:  

- **Sydney Harbour Bridge Cycleway** – A scenic route connecting North Sydney to the city  
- **Cooks River Cycleway** – A mostly flat, family-friendly path from Strathfield to Botany Bay  
- **Bourke Street Cycleway** – A well-used commuter route through the inner suburbs  

Sydney has an active cycling culture with road cyclists, commuters, and recreational riders, but there’s still tension between cyclists and motorists due to limited road-sharing awareness.  

### **Bicycling Across Greater Australia**  
Australia’s cycling culture varies by city and region:  

- **Melbourne** – Arguably the most bike-friendly city, with an extensive network of dedicated lanes and a strong cycling culture.  
- **Canberra** – One of the best cities for cycling, with a well-planned network of bike paths and lower traffic density.  
- **Brisbane** – Improving cycling infrastructure, with river loops and scenic routes.  
- **Adelaide & Perth** – Both have solid cycling networks and more relaxed traffic compared to Sydney.  

Outside cities, Australia offers world-class cycling opportunities in national parks and coastal routes, such as:  

- **Great Ocean Road (VIC)** – A stunning coastal cycling route  
- **Munda Biddi Trail (WA)** – One of the longest off-road cycling trails in the world  
- **Tasmanian East Coast** – A scenic ride through rugged landscapes  

### **Comparing Sydney to Other Australian Locations**  
Compared to other Australian cities, Sydney lags in terms of bike-friendly infrastructure but offers unique, picturesque routes—especially for experienced riders. Melbourne and Canberra generally provide better cycling conditions.  

### **Bicycling in National Parks and Natural Reserves**  
- **Blue Mountains (NSW)** – Tougher trails for mountain bikers  
- **Kosciuszko National Park (NSW)** – High-altitude cycling with scenic views  
- **Daintree Rainforest (QLD)** – Exotic tropical rides through ancient rainforests
